Kapsel CLI Command Help

  kapsel command [options]

Project-Level Commands:

  kapsel package platform_list

    Package the local Kapsel web application project files for the specified
    platforms, or all platforms, into a file that can be deployed to the
    SMP server.

    Valid options for platform are: android, ios. If you omit the
    platform_list, the default is to package all platforms.

  Example usage:

    kapsel package
    kapsel package android
    kapsel package ios
    kapsel package android ios

  kapsel deploy <appid> <server_host[:server_port]> <user_name> <password>

    Uploads the zip generated by the package command to the SMP3 server. Once
    uploaded the application is set to the current version. For
    environments where the SMP server port has been changed from its default
    (8083) you can append the port number to the server host address in the
    format server_host:server_port.

  Example usage

    kapsel deploy com.companyname.hellokapsel server3 theadmin thepass
    kapsel deploy com.companyname.hellokapsel server3:8085 theadmin thepass

  kapsel status <appid> <server_host[:server_port]> <user_name> <password>

    Gives a list of the current, pending, and staged revisions for the given application.

  kapsel upload <appid> <server_host[:server_port]> <user_name> <password>

    Uploads the zip generated by the package command to the SMP3 server.

  kapsel remove <appid> <platform> <revision> <server_host[:server_port]> <user_name> <password>

    Removes the specified pending application from the server.

  kapsel promote <appid> <platform> <revision> <server_host[:server_port]> <user_name> <password>

    Promotes the specified pending application to the current version.

  kapsel stage <appid> <platform> <revision> <server_host[:server_port]> <user_name> <password>

    Stages the given application revision to test users.

  kapsel unstage <appid> <platform> <server_host[:server_port]> <user_name> <password>

    Unstage the given application for the platform.

  kapsel fetch <appid> <server_host:server_port> <user_name> <password> <platform>

    Downloads the current update from the SMP3 server.  Only complete (and not delta)
    updates will be downloaded.
    
    server_port is not the administration port (8083), like most commands, but
    is the communication port (8081), and must be specified.

    <platform> is either Android or iOS.  If it is any other value, or missing,
    it defaults to Android.
    
    <user_name> <password> Most commands use administrator credentials.  fetch
    needs to register with the server and application credentials may be more
    appropraite.
    
    The update is downloaded to a file in the current directory named download.zip
